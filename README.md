# Why TDD?

## Learning objectives
1. Describe TDD as a software development process involving writing tests prior to implementation code.
2. Explain how TDD can result in higher quality code.
3. Use TDD to create an application, allowing failing tests to drive your process.

## Example
```
As a member of the public,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like to get a bike from a docking station.
```

```
As a member of the public,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working.
```

```
As a member of the public,
So I can return bikes I've hired,
I want to dock my bike at the docking station.
```

```
As a member of the public,
So I can decide whether to use the docking station,
I want to see a bike that has been docked.
```

## Instructions (30 minutes)
* Clone this repo and cd into the exercise directory.
* Spend 30 minutes implementing a notebook problem based on the user stories below.
* As a first step, diagram a domain model to help guide your process.
* Use our minimal testing framework to help build the system.  Consciously think about using the error messages you see to make incremental progress. Use the file setup in the exercise directory as a starting point.

```
As an office worker
So I can record useful information
I want to be able to create a note with a title and content
```

```
As an office worker
So I can carry all my useful information
I want to keep all my notes in a notebook.
```

```
As an office worker
So I can categorise a note
I want to be able to add a tag (only one tag) to a note
```

```
As an office worker
So I can find notes on a certain topic
I want to be able to search for all the notes with a specific tag
```

## Plenary (15 minutes)
At the end, we'll gather to show our diagrams and discuss our strategies.
